#### Where to Paste
**Paste this in**: `slynqix/README.md` (overwrite or create).

### 7. `package.json`

#### Purpose
Manages dependencies and scripts for the Node.js/React project.

#### Equivalent in Rust/Leptos
Rust uses `Cargo.toml` for dependencies and build configuration. Some Node.js dependencies (e.g., Tailwind) are still needed for CSS processing.
